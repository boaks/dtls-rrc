1.  Introduction

   In "classical" DTLS, selecting a security context of an incoming DTLS
   record is accomplished with the help of the 5-tuple, i.e. source IP
   address, source port, transport protocol, destination IP address, and
   destination port.  Changes to this 5 tuple can happen for a variety
   reasons over the lifetime of the DTLS session.  In the IoT context,
   NAT rebinding is common with sleepy devices.  Other examples include
   end host mobility and multi-homing.  Without CID, if the source IP
   address and/or source port changes during the lifetime of an ongoing
   DTLS session then the receiver will be unable to locate the correct
   security context.  As a result, the DTLS handshake has to be re-run.
   Of course, it is not necessary to re-run the full handshake if
   session resumption is supported and negotiated.

   A CID is an identifier carried in the record layer header of a DTLS
   datagram that gives the receiver additional information for selecting
   the appropriate security context.  The CID mechanism has been
   specified in [RFC9146] for DTLS 1.2 and in [RFC9147] for DTLS 1.3.

   Section 6 of [RFC9146] describes how the use of CID increases the
   attack surface by providing both on-path and off-path attackers an
   opportunity for (D)DoS.  It then goes on describing the steps a DTLS
   principal must take when a record with a CID is received that has a
   source address (and/or port) different from the one currently
   associated with the DTLS connection.  However, the actual mechanism
   for ensuring that the new peer address is willing to receive and
   process DTLS records is left open.  This document standardizes a
   return routability check (RRC) as part of the DTLS protocol itself.

   The return routability check is performed by the receiving peer
   before the CID-to-IP address/port binding is updated in that peer's
   session state database.  This is done in order to provide more
   confidence to the receiving peer that the sending peer is reachable
   at the indicated address and port.

   Note however that, irrespective of CID, if RRC has been successfully
   negotiated by the peers, path validation can be used at any time by
   either endpoint.  For instance, an endpoint might use RRC to check
   that a peer is still in possession of its address after a period of
   quiescence.

2.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document assumes familiarity with the CID format and protocol
   defined for DTLS 1.2 [RFC9146] and for DTLS 1.3 [RFC9147].  The
   presentation language used in this document is described in Section 4
   of [RFC8446].

   This document reuses the definition of "anti-amplification limit"
   from [RFC9000] to mean three times the amount of data received from
   an unvalidated address.  This includes all DTLS records originating
   from that source address, excluding discarded ones.

3.  RRC Extension

   The use of RRC is negotiated via the rrc DTLS-only extension.  On
   connecting, the client includes the rrc extension in its ClientHello
   if it wishes to use RRC.  If the server is capable of meeting this
   requirement, it responds with a rrc extension in its ServerHello.
   The extension_type value for this extension is TBD1 and the
   extension_data field of this extension is empty.  The client and
   server MUST NOT use RRC unless both sides have successfully exchanged
   rrc extensions.

   Note that the RRC extension applies to both DTLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.3.

4.  The Return Routability Check Message

   When a record with CID is received that has the source address of the
   enclosing UDP datagram different from the one previously associated
   with that CID, the receiver MUST NOT update its view of the peer's IP
   address and port number with the source specified in the UDP datagram
   before cryptographically validating the enclosed record(s) but
   instead perform a return routability check.

   enum {
       invalid(0),
       change_cipher_spec(20),
       alert(21),
       handshake(22),
       application_data(23),
       heartbeat(24),  /* RFC 6520 */
       return_routability_check(TBD2), /* NEW */
       (255)
   } ContentType;

   uint64 Cookie;

   enum {
       path_challenge(0),
       path_response(1),
       path_drop(2),
       reserved(3..255)
   } rrc_msg_type;

   struct {
       rrc_msg_type msg_type;
       select (return_routability_check.msg_type) {
           case path_challenge: Cookie;
           case path_response:  Cookie;
           case path_drop:      Cookie;
       };
   } return_routability_check;

   The cookie is a 8-byte field containing arbitrary data.

   The return_routability_check message MUST be authenticated and
   encrypted using the currently active security context.

5.  Off-Path Packet Forwarding

   An off-path attacker that can observe packets might forward copies of
   genuine packets to endpoints over a different path.  If the copied
   packet arrives before the genuine packet, this will appear as a path
   change, like in a genuine NAT rebinding occurrence.  Any genuine
   packet will be discarded as a duplicate.  If the attacker is able to
   continue forwarding packets, it might be able to cause migration to a
   path via the attacker.  This places the attacker on-path, giving it
   the ability to observe or drop all subsequent packets.

   This style of attack relies on the attacker using a path that has the
   same or better characteristics (e.g., due to a more favourable
   service level agreements) as the direct path between endpoints.  The
   attack is more reliable if relatively few packets are sent or if
   packet loss coincides with the attempted attack.

   A data packet received on the original path that increases the
   maximum received packet number will cause the endpoint to move back
   to that path.  Therefore, eliciting packets on this path increases
   the likelihood that the attack is unsuccessful.  Note however that,
   unlike QUIC, DTLS has no "non-probing" packets so this would require
   application specific mechanisms.

   Figure 1 illustrates the case where a receiver receives a packet with
   a new source IP address and/or new port number.  In order to
   determine whether this path change was not triggered by an off-path
   attacker, the receiver will send a RRC message of type path_challenge
   (1) on the old path.

               Figure 1: Off-Path Packet Forwarding Scenario

   Three cases need to be considered:

   Case 1: The old path is dead (e.g., due to a NAT rebinding), which
   leads to a timeout of (1).

   As shown in Figure 2, a path_challenge (2) needs to be sent on the
   new path.  If the sender replies with a path_response on the new path
   (3), the switch to the new path is considered legitimate.

                               '----------'

                         Figure 2: Old path is dead

   Case 2: The old path is alive but not preferred.

   This case is shown in Figure 3 whereby the sender replies with a
   path_drop message (2) on the old path.  This triggers the receiver to
   send a path_challenge (3) on the new path.  The sender will reply
   with a path_response (4) on the new path, thus providing confirmation
   for the path migration.

                    Figure 3: Old path is not preferred

   Case 3: The old path is alive and preferred.

   This is most likely the result of an off-path attacker trying to
   place itself on path.  The receiver sends a path_challenge on the old
   path and the sender replies with a path_response (2) on the old path.
   The interaction is shown in Figure 4.  This results in the connection
   not being migrated to the new path, thus thwarting the attack.

                             '----------'

                      Figure 4: Old path is preferred

   Note that this defense is imperfect, but this is not considered a
   serious problem.  If the path via the attack is reliably faster than
   the old path despite multiple attempts to use that old path, it is
   not possible to distinguish between an attack and an improvement in
   routing.

   An endpoint could also use heuristics to improve detection of this
   style of attack.  For instance, NAT rebinding is improbable if
   packets were recently received on the old path; similarly, rebinding
   is rare on IPv6 paths.  Endpoints can also look for duplicated
   packets.  Conversely, a change in connection ID is more likely to
   indicate an intentional migration rather than an attack.  Note that
   changes in connection IDs are supported in DTLS 1.3 but not in DTLS
   1.2.

6.  Path Validation Procedure

   Note: This algorithm does not take the Section 5 scenario into
   account.

   The receiver that observes the peer's address or port update MUST
   stop sending any buffered application data (or limit the data sent to
   the unvalidated address to the anti-amplification limit) and initiate
   the return routability check that proceeds as follows:

   1.  The receiver creates a return_routability_check message of type
       path_challenge and places the unpredictable cookie into the
       message.

   2.  The message is sent to the observed new address and a timer T
       (see Section 7.3) is started.

   3.  The peer endpoint, after successfully verifying the received
       return_routability_check message responds by echoing the cookie
       value in a return_routability_check message of type
       path_response.

   4.  When the initiator receives and verifies the
       return_routability_check message contains the sent cookie, it
       updates the peer address binding.

   5.  If T expires, or the address confirmation fails, the peer address
       binding is not updated.

   After this point, any pending send operation is resumed to the bound
   peer address.

   Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 contain the requirements for the
   initiator and responder roles, broken down per protocol phase.

7.  Enhanced Path Validation Procedure

   Note: This algorithm also takes the Section 5 scenario into account.

   The receiver that observes the peer's address or port update MUST
   stop sending any buffered application data (or limit the data sent to
   the unvalidated address to the anti-amplification limit) and initiate
   the return routability check that proceeds as follows:

   1.  The receiver creates a return_routability_check message of type
       path_challenge and places the unpredictable cookie into the
       message.

   2.  The message is sent to the previously valid address, which
       corresponds to the old path.  Additionally, a timer T, see
       Section 7.3, is started.

   3.  The peer endpoint verifies the received return_routability_check
       message.  The action to be taken depends on the preference of the
       path through which the message was received:

       *  If the path through which the message was received is
          preferred, a return_routability_check message of type
          path_response MUST be returned.

       *  If the path through which the message was received is not
          preferred, a return_routability_check message of type
          path_drop MUST be returned.  In either case, the peer endpoint
          echoes the cookie value in the response.

   4.  The initiator receives and verifies that the
       return_routability_check message contains the previously sent
       cookie.  The actions taken by the initiator differ based on the
       received message:

       *  When a return_routability_check message of type path_response
          was received, the initiator MUST continue using the previously
          valid address, i.e. no switch to the new path takes place and
          the peer address binding is not updated.

       *  When a return_routability_check message of type path_drop was
          received, the initiator MUST perform a return routability
          check on the observed new address, as described in Section 6.

   5.  If T expires, or the address confirmation fails, the peer address
       binding is not updated.  In this case, the initiator MUST perform
       a return routability check on the observed new address, as
       described in Section 6.

   After the path validation procedure is completed, any pending send
   operation is resumed to the bound peer address.

   Section 7.1 and Section 7.2 contain the requirements for the
   initiator and responder roles, broken down per protocol phase.

7.1.   Path Challenge Requirements

   *  The initiator MAY send multiple return_routability_check messages
      of type path_challenge to cater for packet loss on the probed
      path.

      -  Each path_challenge SHOULD go into different transport packets.
         (Note that the DTLS implementation may not have control over
         the packetization done by the transport layer.)

      -  The transmission of subsequent path_challenge messages SHOULD
         be paced to decrease the chance of loss.

      -  Each path_challenge message MUST contain random data.

   *  The initiator MAY use padding using the record padding mechanism
      available in DTLS 1.3 (and in DTLS 1.2, when CID is enabled on the
      sending direction) up to the anti-amplification limit to probe if
      the path MTU (PMTU) for the new path is still acceptable.

7.2.  Path Response/Drop Requirements

   *  The responder MUST NOT delay sending an elicited path_response or
      path_drop messages.

   *  The responder MUST send exactly one path_response or path_drop
      message for each received path_challenge.

   *  The responder MUST send the path_response or the path_drop on the
      path where the corresponding path_challenge has been received, so
      that validation succeeds only if the path is functional in both
      directions.  The initiator MUST NOT enforce this behaviour.

   *  The initiator MUST silently discard any invalid path_response it
      receives.

   Note that RRC does not cater for PMTU discovery on the reverse path.
   If the responder wants to do PMTU discovery using RRC, it should
   initiate a new path validation procedure.

7.3.  Timer Choice

   When setting T, implementations are cautioned that the new path could
   have a longer round-trip time (RTT) than the original.

   In settings where there is external information about the RTT of the
   active path, implementations SHOULD use T = 3xRTT.

   If an implementation has no way to obtain information regarding the
   RTT of the active path, a value of 1s SHOULD be used.

   Profiles for specific deployment environments -- for example,
   constrained networks [I-D.ietf-uta-tls13-iot-profile] -- MAY specify
   a different, more suitable value.

8.  Example

   The example TLS 1.3 handshake shown in Figure 5 shows a client and a
   server negotiating the support for CID and for the RRC extension.

       Client                                           Server

                                                  ServerHello  ^ Key
                                                 +  key_share  | Exch
                                          + connection_id=100  |
                                                        + rrc  v
                                        {EncryptedExtensions}  ^  Server
                                         {CertificateRequest}  v  Params
                                                {Certificate}  ^
                                          {CertificateVerify}  | Auth
                               <--------           {Finished}  v

     ^ {Certificate}

              +  Indicates noteworthy extensions sent in the
                 previously noted message.

              *  Indicates optional or situation-dependent
                 messages/extensions that are not always sent.

              {} Indicates messages protected using keys
                 derived from a [sender]_handshake_traffic_secret.

              [] Indicates messages protected using keys
                 derived from [sender]_application_traffic_secret_N.

            Figure 5: Message Flow for Full TLS Handshake

   Once a connection has been established the client and the server
   exchange application payloads protected by DTLS with an unilaterally
   used CIDs.  In our case, the client is requested to use CID 100 for
   records sent to the server.

   At some point in the communication interaction the IP address used by
   the client changes and, thanks to the CID usage, the security context
   to interpret the record is successfully located by the server.
   However, the server wants to test the reachability of the client at
   his new IP address.

         Client                                             Server

9.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   Note that the return routability checks do not protect against
   flooding of third-parties if the attacker is on-path, as the attacker
   can redirect the return routability checks to the real peer (even if
   those datagrams are cryptographically authenticated).  On-path
   adversaries can, in general, pose a harm to connectivity.

10.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to allocate an entry to the TLS ContentType
   registry, for the return_routability_check(TBD2) message defined in
   this document.  The return_routability_check content type is only
   applicable to DTLS 1.2 and 1.3.

   IANA is requested to allocate the extension code point (TBD1) for the
   rrc extension to the TLS ExtensionType Values registry as described
   in Table 1.

     +=======+===========+=====+===========+=============+===========+
     | Value | Extension | TLS | DTLS-Only | Recommended | Reference |
     |       | Name      | 1.3 |           |             |           |
     +=======+===========+=====+===========+=============+===========+
     | TBD1  | rrc       | CH, | Y         | N           | RFC-THIS  |
     |       |           | SH  |           |             |           |
