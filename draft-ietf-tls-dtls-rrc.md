--- abstract

This document specifies a return routability check for use in context of the
Connection ID (CID) construct for the Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)
protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3.

# Introduction

In "classical" DTLS, selecting a security context of an incoming DTLS record is
accomplished with the help of the 5-tuple, i.e. source IP address, source port,
transport protocol, destination IP address, and destination port.  Changes to
this 5 tuple can happen for a variety reasons over the lifetime of the DTLS
session.  In the IoT context, NAT rebinding is common with sleepy devices.
Other examples include end host mobility and multi-homing.  Without CID, if the
source IP address and/or source port changes during the lifetime of an ongoing
DTLS session then the receiver will be unable to locate the correct security
context.  As a result, the DTLS handshake has to be re-run.  Of course, it is
not necessary to re-run the full handshake if session resumption is supported
and negotiated.

A CID is an identifier carried in the record layer header of a DTLS datagram
that gives the receiver additional information for selecting the appropriate
security context.  The CID mechanism has been specified in
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}} for DTLS 1.2 and in
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}} for DTLS 1.3.

Section 6 of {{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}} describes how the use of CID
increases the attack surface by providing both on-path and off-path attackers
an opportunity for (D)DoS.  It then goes on describing the steps a DTLS
principal must take when a record with a CID is received that has a source
address (and/or port) different from the one currently associated with the DTLS
connection.  However, the actual mechanism for ensuring that the new peer
address is willing to receive and process DTLS records is left open.  This
document standardizes a return routability check (RRC) as part of the DTLS
protocol itself.

The return routability check is performed by the receiving peer before the
CID-to-IP address/port binding is updated in that peer's session state
database.  This is done in order to provide more confidence to the receiving
peer that the sending peer is reachable at the indicated address and port.

Note however that, irrespective of CID, if RRC has been successfully negotiated
by the peers, path validation can be used at any time by either endpoint. For
instance, an endpoint might check that a peer is still in possession of its
address after a period of quiescence.

# Conventions and Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

This document assumes familiarity with the CID format and protocol defined for
DTLS 1.2 {{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls-connection-id}} and for DTLS 1.3
{{!I-D.ietf-tls-dtls13}}.  The presentation language used in this document is
described in Section 4 of {{!RFC8446}}.

This document reuses the definition of "anti-amplification limit" from
{{?RFC9000}} to mean three times the amount of data received from an
unvalidated address.

# RRC Extension

The use of RRC is negotiated via the `rrc` DTLS-only extension.  On connecting,
the client includes the `rrc` extension in its ClientHello if it wishes to use
RRC.  If the server is capable of meeting this requirement, it responds with a
`rrc` extension in its ServerHello.  The `extension_type` value for this
extension is TBD1 and the `extension_data` field of this extension is empty.
The client and server MUST NOT use RRC unless both sides have successfully
exchanged `rrc` extensions.

Note that the RRC extension applies to both DTLS 1.2 and DTLS 1.3.

# The Return Routability Check Message

When a record with CID is received that has the source address of the enclosing
UDP datagram different from the one previously associated with that CID, the
receiver MUST NOT update its view of the peer's IP address and port number with
the source specified in the UDP datagram before cryptographically validating
the enclosed record(s) but instead perform a return routability check.

    };
} return_routability_check;
~~~~

The newly introduced `return_routability_check` message contains a cookie.  The
cookie is a 8-byte field containing arbitrary data.

The `return_routability_check` message MUST be authenticated and encrypted using
the currently active security context.

# Path Validation Procedure

The receiver that observes the peer's address or port update MUST stop sending
any buffered application data (or limit the data sent to the unvalidated
address to the anti-amplification limit) and initiate the return routability
check that proceeds as follows:

1. An unpredictable cookie is placed in a `return_routability_check` message of
   type path_challenge;
1. The message is sent to the observed new address and a timer T (see
   {{timer-choice}}) is started;
1. The peer endpoint, after successfully verifying the received
   `return_routability_check` message responds by echoing the cookie value in a
   `return_routability_check` message of type path_response;
1. When the initiator receives and verifies the `return_routability_check`
   message contains the sent cookie, it updates the peer address binding;
1. If T expires, or the address confirmation fails, the peer address binding is
   not updated.

After this point, any pending send operation is resumed to the bound peer
address.

{{path-challenge-reqs}} and {{path-response-reqs}} contain the requirments for
the initiator and responder roles, broken down per protocol phase.

##Â Path Challenge Requirements {#path-challenge-reqs}

* The initiator MAY send multiple `return_routability_check` message of type
  path_challenge to cater for packet loss on the probed path.
  * Each path_challenge SHOULD go into different transport packets.
  * Each path_challenge MUST have different unpredictable data.
* The initiator MAY use padding using the record padding mechanism available in
  DTLS 1.3, and 1.2 when CID is enabled on its sending direction) up to the
  anti-amplification limit to probe if the PMTU for the new path is still
  acceptable.

## Path Response Requirements {#path-response-reqs}

* The responder MUST NOT delay sending an elicited path_response message.
* The responder MUST send exactly one path_response messages for each received
  path_request.
* The responder MUST send the path_response on the network path where the
  corresponding path_challenge has been received, so that validation succeeds
  only if the path is functional in both directions.
  * The initiator MUST NOT enforce this behaviour
* The responder MAY use padding using the record padding mechanism available in
  DTLS 1.3, and 1.2 when CID is enabled on its sending direction) up to the
  anti-amplification limit to probe if the PMTU for the new path is still
  acceptable.

## Timer Choice

When setting T, implementations are cautioned that the new path could have a
longer round-trip time than the original.

In settings where there is external information about the RTT, implementations
SHOULD use [1.5,3]xRTT estimate as T.
<cref>TODO pick a number in the interval</cref>

If an implementation has no way to obtain information regarding the current
RTT, a value of 1s SHOULD be used.  If there is a-priori knowledge of the
network environment (e.g., endpoints deployed in constrained networks) a
different, more suitable value MAY be chosen.

# Example

and a server negotiating the support for CID and for the RRC extension.

{: #fig-handshake title="Message Flow for Full TLS Handshake"}

Once a connection has been established the client and the server
exchange application payloads protected by DTLS with an unilaterally used
CIDs. In our case, the client is requested to use CID 100 for records
sent to the server.

At some point in the communication interaction the IP address used by
the client changes and, thanks to the CID usage, the security context to
interpret the record is successfully located by the server.  However, the
server wants to test the reachability of the client at his new IP address.

# Security and Privacy Considerations

Note that the return routability checks do not protect against flooding of
third-parties if the attacker is on-path, as the attacker can redirect the
return routability checks to the real peer (even if those datagrams are
cryptographically authenticated).  On-path adversaries can, in general, pose a
harm to connectivity.

# IANA Considerations

IANA is requested to allocate an entry to the TLS `ContentType`
registry, for the `return_routability_check(TBD2)` defined in this document.
The `return_routability_check` content type is only applicable to DTLS 1.2 and
1.3.

IANA is requested to allocate the extension code point (TBD1) for the `rrc`
extension to the `TLS ExtensionType Values` registry as described in
{{tbl-ext}}.

| Value | Extension Name | TLS 1.3 | DTLS-Only | Recommended | Reference |
